# karuta-drop-analysis
As of now, the bot just collects the card data and updates it.

# Getting Started
To use this, do the following:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the requirements.txt file.
3. Set up a discord bot and create an env file with a token. Example: `TOKEN=your-token-goes-here`
4. Run the main.py file and add the bot to your server.

Once the bot is up and running, it will listen for karuta's embeds containing Character Lookup i.e. the k!lu command output and update or add the details in the sqlite database as needed.
